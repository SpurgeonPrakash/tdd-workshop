## Abstract

- make clear in the abstract that we will be pairing (though optionally)

## Timing

- intro took way shorter. we were into jest by 1:20.

- break at 1:30 & 3:00

## Docs

- https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/854 - install watchman on macs if fsevents error; sometimes homebrew fails to link the keg because of permissions, and that can be resolved by manually linking.

### clean up docs for game of life. They're hard to follow.

- Need better direction on how they start. "a good first test would be that it returns a grid the same size."

- Better docs on 3x3 vs 40x40. They don't need to change the app, they need to write tests that are less noisy.

## Exercises

- Vulnerabilities

- Make ex 3 collaborative

- Swap modules 4 & 5

- Make 4 (5 after swapping) a "bonus"

## Slides

- put links to repo in exercise slides? or somehow tell them they should be working on module-3 in the repo
