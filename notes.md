put links to repo in exercise slides? or somehow tell them they should be working on module-3 in the repo

/module-3/README.md

clean up docs for game of life. They're hard to follow.
1. Need better direction on how they start. "a good first test would be that it returns a grid the same size."
2. Better docs on 3x3 vs 40x40. They don't need to change the app, they need to write tests that are less noisy.
