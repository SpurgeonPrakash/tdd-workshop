# Module: Jest

## Background

This module allows you to explore the Jest watch-mode. 

The code under test is a "âœ¨JavaScript Unicorn ðŸ¦„ Name Generator âœ¨". The rules for generating names can be seen in [the table at the end of this README](#generation-rules). 

## Start up the tests

ðŸ‘‰ Open a new command window from the root of this project. Type `npm run test-module-1`. This will start up the test suite.

When the test suite starts running, it will give you a message that reads 

`No tests found related to files changed since last commit.`

This is because you haven't made any local changes. By default, Jest only runs tests for files that have been affected by your local changes. This is really helpful for Test-Driven Development - it allows you to focus on the code you're currently writing.

### Running all tests

Jest does offer the ability to run all tests in your test suite. Let's do that now!

ðŸ‘‰ In the Jest watch window, hit `w`, then `a`. 

This will run all tests in the test suite. Now, you should see a bunch of tests run! (And succeed!)

At any time, you can change the tests being run by hitting the `w` key, and selecting the tests you want to run. 

Jest offers you several options by which to filter your tests: 

* `a`: Run all tests.
* `f`: Run only tests that failed in their last run. This is useful when you break stuff, and want to focus on just the tests that you need to fix.
* `p`: Run tests filtered by a filename regex pattern. This can be useful if you want to run all tests in a specific folder.
* `t`: Run tests filtered by a test name regex pattern. This is useful when you want to run all tests related to a specific feature.
* `o`: Run only tests that are affected by local changes since your last commit. This is the default when you start up Jest.

Let's try a few of these out.

### Running tests filtered by filename

ðŸ‘‰ In the Jest watch window, hit `w`, then `p`. 

ðŸ‘‰ Type ????? to filter by filenames containing ??????.

You should see ??? tests run. All of them are in the ???? file.

### Running tests filtered by test name

Do I have to clear?????

ðŸ‘‰ In the Jest watch window, hit `w`, then `t`. 

ðŸ‘‰ Type ????? to filter by test names containing ??????.

You should see ??? tests run. All of them contain the word ????. 

Do I have to clear again?

### Running only tests affected by your latest changes.

Let's go back to the default - running only tests affected by your latest changes.

ðŸ‘‰ In the Jest watch window, hit `w`, then `o`. 

You'll see the message again that "no tests were found related to your latest changes." 

Let's make some changes!

birth month is missing tests???? Let's write some???



  Add a test
    Open ./????/???.spec.js
    Add a test for some condition
    Save file
      View terminal - did it pass?
        yes: move on to next test
        no: figure out why it's not passing
      Debugging tips:
        console.log
        VS Code debugger
